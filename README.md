### Project Title
I named this project "Why did the patients no-show?".
We are going to explore the dataset from 100K medical appointments in Brazil with 14 variables about the patient. 

### Description
we will investigate the factors that can explain why the patients made a no-show to a medical appointment and might predict who will make a no-show in the future. 
Mainly, we will go over three variables: 1) if the patients received an SMS that informs the appointment details, 2) age of the patients and finally
3) the waiting time between the day the patients scheduled and the actual appointment day.

Intuitively, we assume that the patients who recieved a notification via an SMS would not miss the appointment because they have the information with them all the time 
on the phone. Also, we often think that it is more likely for the older people to show up at the appointment while the young people will not show up 
because health issues are more critical to the elderly. Finally, it is easier for people to presume that the longer the waiting time, 
the higher the chance of no-show because people can get well naturally, they can find a faster appointment in another clinic or simply they can forget.

We will investigate if our intuitive assumptions are correct by taking each of the three variables through the analysis. 
One important messages for you is that these findings is tentative in terms of prediction, 
as we did not use inferencial method. Let's find out what the data are actually telling us about the patients' behaviors.
